INTERFERON is an LED art installation located in a private residence in San Francisco, CA. This program controls 320 individually addressable LEDs, and mimics interference patterns we see everywhere in nature: ripples in a pond, wheat fields blowing in the wind, and waves colliding on the beach.

The system consists of a Raspberry Pi 3, [FadeCandy controller](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1689), and WS2812 LEDs.

### Installation:

1. Download [Processing 3](https://processing.org/download/?processing)
2. Install [Fadecandy server](https://github.com/scanlime/fadecandy)
3. Clone this repo into your Processing sketchbook folder

Special thanks to [Mark Slee](https://github.com/mcslee/) & [Heron Arts](https://github.com/heronarts/) for developing [LX Studio](http://lx.studio) and the [P3LX library]((https://github.com/heronarts/P3LX)), which powers INTERFERON.
