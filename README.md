INTERFERON is an LED art installation located in a private residence in San Francisco. This program controls 320 individually addressable LEDs, which oscillates between abstract and concrete interference patterns.

The system consists of a Raspberry Pi 3, [FadeCandy controller](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1689), and WS2812 LEDs.
